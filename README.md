### The Problem

With the growth of the suburbs in the last 50 years, more people have to drive to work everyday. This has lead to an increase in traffic and [pedestrian fatalities](https://www.ghsa.org/resources/news-releases/pedestrians20). This project applies machine learning to accidents involving pedestrians and predicts severity of injury to aid medics responding to the accident. 


### The Data

The [dataset](https://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/SDOT/GIS/Collisions_OD.pdf) contains real collision data from the Seattle Police Department (SPD) all the way back to 2004. It contains information on the severity of the collision which is what we will be trying to predict. For this oroject, we will be looking at the following columns to assess pedestrian injury severity.

* SEVERITYCODE - The severity of the accident. This is our y variable and the value we are trying to predict. A 0 means that there was property damage only and a 1 means that there was some physical injury.
* ST_COLCODE - The code of the collision. Used to describe the accident.
* PEDCOUNT - Wheather or not there were pedestrians involved.
* PERROWNOTGRNT - Whetheror not the pedestrians right of way was granted.
* SPEEDING - Was the driver speeding?

There are a number of data manipulations that had to be performed on the data to transform it into the correct format for the machine learning model.
